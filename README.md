# EC424-Essay
Extended Essay on Monetary Economics course as part of EC424

This repository includes data and code that I have used in order to write an extended essay for my monetary economics course. 

The data is included as an Excel file.

All the code was written in R. This was my first project in R and I learnt it along the way, so the code isn't well organised and may be difficult to reproduce exactly. I will organise it and update this page in a little while. The tables and graphs were all generated in R and imported to latex.

It also includes a latex file, bib file which houses all the citations in the latex file and a final compiled version as a pdf file.
